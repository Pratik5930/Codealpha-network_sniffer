# Codealpha-network_sniffer
A Basic Network Sniffer built in Python as part of my Cyber Security Internship at CodeAlpha. This tool captures, decodes, and displays network packets in real time, providing insights into network traffic. A great starting point for learning packet inspection and socket programming.
